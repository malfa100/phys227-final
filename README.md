[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/malfa100/phys227-final.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/malfa100/phys227-final)

## Specification

Consider the following coupled first-order ODEs:
$$\dot{x}=-y-z, \qquad \dot{y}=x+ay, \qquad \dot{z}=b+z(x-c)$$
where $x(t), \ y(t), \ z(t)$ are real-valued functions of time and $a=b=0.2$ and $c$ is a parameter that will be tuned. Explore the nonlinearity from the single nonlinear term $xz$.

4th-order Runge-Kutta is used to solve coupled first order ODEs and various 2 and 3 dimensional graphs are created.
Local maxima for different c parameters are found and graphed with respect to c, creating a bifurcation diagram.

## Assessment

I enjoyed the alternative approach to the bifurcation diagram. I feel that this final was an appropriate level of difficulty. It had some interesting challenges which took some time to figure out but it was doable.

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,
